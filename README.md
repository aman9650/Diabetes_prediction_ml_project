# Diabetes_prediction_ml_project
1. Developed a machine learning project on diabetes prediction, achieving an accuracy of 78%.
2. Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the dataset, identify patterns, and inform feature selection.
3. Utilized feature selection techniques to identify the most relevant features for the prediction task.
4. Applied feature scaling methods such as standardization or normalization to ensure fair comparisons between features.
5. Implemented and compared multiple machine learning algorithms, including Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Random Forest, to optimize the prediction accuracy.

6. Demonstrated proficiency in Python programming for implementing the project and utilizing libraries such as scikit-learn, pandas, and numpy.
